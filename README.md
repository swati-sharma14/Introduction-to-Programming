📚 Polynomial Root Finder 🔍

Welcome to the Polynomial Root Finder! This code allows you to find the roots of a given polynomial function using the Newton-Raphson method. 🌱

📝 Description
This code implements the Newton-Raphson method to iteratively approximate the roots of a polynomial function. The user needs to provide the coefficients of the polynomial, and the code will calculate the roots based on those coefficients.

🛠️ Usage
1. Define your polynomial function by specifying its coefficients.
2. Call the find_roots function and pass the coefficients as a list.
3. The code will perform Newton-Raphson iterations to find the root(s) of the polynomial.
4. The function will return the approximate root if convergence is achieved within the maximum number of iterations.
5. If the root does not converge within the specified tolerance or maximum number of iterations, the function will return None.
