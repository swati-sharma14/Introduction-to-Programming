🧮 Matrix Traversal and Analysis 🚀

Welcome to the Matrix Traversal and Analysis program! This program allows you to traverse and analyze matrices in various ways.


📝 Description

The program offers different options for matrix traversal and analysis. Here's a breakdown of the available functionalities:

1. Normal Traversal: Prints the matrix by traversing each row.
2. Alternating Traversal: Prints the matrix by traversing each row alternately in both directions.
3. Spiral Traversal: Prints the matrix in a spiral pattern starting from the outermost layer and moving towards the center.
4. Boundary Traversal: Prints the elements on the boundary of the matrix in a clockwise manner.
5. Diagonal Traversal from right to left: Prints the elements in diagonal order from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner.
6. Diagonal Traversal from left to right: Prints the elements in diagonal order from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.


🛠️ Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of rows/columns in the matrix when prompted.
3. Enter the matrix elements row-wise.
4. Choose an option from the menu by entering a valid integer between 1 and 6.
5. The program will perform the selected traversal or analysis operation on the matrix and display the result.
