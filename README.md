📚 Geometric Shape Calculator 📐

Welcome to the Geometric Shape Calculator! This code allows you to calculate the properties of various 2D and 3D shapes based on user input. 🎓

📝 Description
This code provides an interactive interface to compute and display the properties of different geometric shapes. Users can choose between 2D and 3D shapes and select specific shapes from a menu. The code then prompts the user for the required measurements and calculates properties such as area, perimeter, volume, and surface area, depending on the chosen shape.

🛠️ Usage
1. Start by specifying the number of students in the class (for reference purposes).
2. Choose the geometric shape you want to calculate properties for: 2D or 3D.
3. If you selected 2D, a menu will be displayed with available shapes. Type the shape code to select the desired shape.
4. Input the required measurements for the chosen shape.
5. Observe the calculated properties for the selected shape.
