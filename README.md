📚 3D Shape Transformation Calculator with User Queries 🔄

Welcome to the 3D Shape Transformation Calculator! This interactive code allows you to explore and manipulate 3D shapes through scaling, translation, and rotation. 🚀

📝 Description
This code implements a powerful calculator that enables you to apply various transformations to a set of 3D coordinates. With just a few queries, you can witness the magic of shape manipulation in real-time. The available transformations include:

1. Scaling: Resize the shape along the x, y, and z axes.
2. Translation: Move the shape in space by specifying the desired coordinates.
3. Rotation: Rotate the shape around the x, y, or z-axis.

Each transformation is performed using separate functions, ensuring a modular and organized code structure. The calculations are based on matrix operations, ensuring precision and efficiency.

🛠️ Usage
1. Provide the number of transformation queries you want to apply.
2. For each query, follow these steps:
  - Specify the type of transformation: scaling (S), translation (T), or rotation (R).
  - Enter the corresponding parameters for the chosen transformation.
    - Scaling: Provide scaling factors for each axis (sx, sy, sz).
    - Translation: Specify the translation distances for each axis (tx, ty, tz).
    - Rotation: Choose the axis of rotation (x, y, or z) and the angle of rotation (th).
3. Sit back and watch the shape transform before your eyes!

Feel free to experiment and unleash your creativity by trying out different combinations of transformations. 🎨
