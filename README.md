📚 Polynomial Function Visualization 📈

Welcome to the Polynomial Function Visualization tool! This code allows you to input the details of a polynomial function and visualize its graph by printing asterisks (*). 🌌

📝 Description
This code enables you to interactively provide the details of a polynomial function and observe its graph in a unique way. By entering the degree of the polynomial, coefficients, lower and upper bounds for x, and the increment step, you can generate a visual representation of the function using asterisks. Each asterisk represents the function's output at a specific x-value.

🛠️ Usage
1. Begin by providing the details of the polynomial function:
  - Enter the degree of the polynomial (highest power).
  - Input the coefficients of the polynomial based on the degree.
2. Specify the lower and upper bounds for x, defining the range for graph visualization.
3. Choose the step size by which you want to increment x for each calculation.
4. Watch the graph unfold as the code generates asterisks based on the function's output.
